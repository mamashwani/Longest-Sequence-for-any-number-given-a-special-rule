# Longest-Sequence-for-any-number-given-a-special-rule
Using python, write a program that will determine the longest sequence generated by a special rule. The program can begin from any number and if the number in the sequence is even, it should be floor divided by 2. If the number is odd, then it should be multiplied by 3 and added to 1. The program should keep track of all the numbers as it progresses to 2 million. 

# Objective
- We would like to find and print the longest sequence for any starting number up to two million (2,000,000).
- Create a function that will generate the next number in the sequence given the current value. 
- Construct a function that will determine if a number is even or odd.
- Compute sequences that start with all positive integers up to two million.
- Find the longest sequence for stating values up to two million.
- Display the starting value, length, and sequence.
- No input from the user is required.
